## Up to date ck-sources
This overlay adds an ebuild for ck-sources that I will try to make sure is up to date with latest kernels.

Ebuild includes latest patchset from [Con Kolivas](http://www.users.on.net/~ckolivas/kernel/) which includes MuQSS process scheduler.

Includes CPU optimisations patch by [greysky2](https://github.com/graysky2/kernel_gcc_patch)


## Install

`eselect repository enable pross`

-or-

`layman -a pross`
