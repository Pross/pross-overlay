## Up to date ck-sources
This overlay adds an ebuild for ck-sources that I will try to make sure is up to date with latest kernels.

Ebuild includes latest patchset from [Con Kolivas](http://www.users.on.net/~ckolivas/kernel/) which includes MuQSS process scheduler with latest [genpatches](https://dev.gentoo.org/~mpagano/genpatches/).




## Install

`layman -a pross`
