![Latest CK Kernel](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/funtoo_1.4/ck-sources.svg)

## Up to date ck-sources
This overlay adds an ebuild for ck-sources that I will try to make sure is up to date with latest kernels.

Ebuild includes latest patchset from [Con Kolivas](http://www.users.on.net/~ckolivas/kernel/) which includes MuQSS process scheduler.

## Install

`eselect repository enable pross`

-or-

`layman -a pross`
